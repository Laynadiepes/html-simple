        <p>Hacksaw Ridge is a 2016 biographical war film directed by Mel Gibson and written by Andrew Knight and Robert

        <p>
            The film focuses on the World War II experiences of Desmond Doss, an American pacifist combat medic who, as a
            Seventh-day Adventist Christian, refused to carry or use a weapon or firearm of any kind. Doss became the first
            conscientious objector to be awarded the Medal of Honor, for service above and beyond the call of duty during
            the Battle of Okinawa. Andrew Garfield stars as Doss, with Sam Worthington, Luke Bracey, Teresa Palmer, Hugo
            Weaving, Rachel Griffiths, Vince Vaughn and Richard Pyros in supporting roles.
