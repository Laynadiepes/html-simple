    <p>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, completed in the winter of 1949 and published in 1950, is the first novel
        in the series in order of publication; however, the second in chronological order. It tells the story of four
        human children: Pedro, Susana, Edmundo and Lúcia Pevensie, who, through an ancient and mysterious wardrobe,
        arrive in the world of Narnia, a lush country that faces a terrible and prolonged winter, imposed by the false
        queen of the country, Jadis (the White Witch), who was already one hundred years old. With the help of the great
        and powerful lion Aslan, the Pevensie brothers must defeat the terrible sorceress and bring peace back to Narnia
        and all who inhabit it.</p>
